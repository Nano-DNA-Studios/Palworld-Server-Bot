# Palworld Server Bot

Palworld Server Bot is a Typescript project that Bundles a Discord Bot into a Docker Container alongside SteamCMD and a Palworld Dedicated Server App. The Bot will directly control Server Operations, and has a connection with the RESTFUL API the Server Hosts. This allows it to access and get info from the Server along with shutting it down, or restarting it for Maintenance
